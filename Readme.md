# AMBA AXI SystemC TLM Approximately Timed Performance Model

## AXI Basics:

In this project we are going to imagine a scenario of a AXI Master and AXI Target module connected by AMBA AXI4 bus. The master could be a hardware accelerator creating a series of Read/Write demands to the target which could be the host memory.
